We live in an age where if we set out to learn something new, it is not just that thing but there are many connected things that you also need to learn and understand first. This is not always true, but especially true if you are out to learn something deeply.

A shallow understanding of things won't take you very far. But deep knowledge takes considerable effort and requires you to learn consistently for a long time.

Let me present an example:

__Kubernetes__ is one of the hottest techs at this point. I have to try to get a better understanding of it for quite some time. Now knowing kubernetes requires you to master many things

- Understand the networking stack, subnets, DNS
- Understand containers, docker
- Many commands for the tools required to talk to Kubernetes `kubectl`, `kubens`, and `kubectx` to name a few.
- YAML (you need to get proficient writing, reading and debugging YAML)
- Understand latency, redundancy, and scalability.
- Write and Understand Go(Kubernetes is built using Go) so it will help you to know go so that you can script some part of it using the same stack.
- Read enough horror/war stories using Kubernetes, something like (https://k8s.af). Those who don't learn from other's mistakes are bound to repeat it
- Another example could be learning backend development with Django.

It is said Django comes with batteries included, but they are not free. The features come at a cost of you learning that stuff.

- Understand how the model layer works. Also, means that you understand how SQL works behind the scenes. Just knowing the ORM can only take you so far.
- Understand the basic HTTP Request/Response Cycle if you want to build efficient web services
- Understand Caching(Redis/Memcache) to scale a production website.
- Understand the Queuing system like RabbitMQ, Celery to run a production-grade website
- Learn Python (preferably Python3) and the meta-programming well to program Django app efficiently.
- Learn important libraries like DRF(Django Rest Framework) to build correct and RESTful APIs.
- Authentication. Authorization and Security are very important as well.

The key here is to plan for the long term and not just short term learning. Shallow/Little knowledge is dangerous and always comes to bit back.
