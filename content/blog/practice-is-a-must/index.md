<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wouldn’t go that far. There is a base rate of practice for many things that is necessary to properly understand them. Without “putting in the reps”, which is rarely creative, you are doomed to a superficial understanding, and many great things only come from deep understanding.</p>&mdash; John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1311343418422046721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

John Carmack is one of the best programmers of our age. When he gives his opinion on something, it is usually based on some real and solid experience. In his above response to a tweet, he says you can't become truly great at something, unless you really practice adequately. If you don't grind enough, you might end up with a shallow understanding of the topic at hand and that is never a good thing. I totally agree with John here, I personally have tried to slack off and tried to take the easy way but it never worked that well for me. So, if you really want to get good at something, don't be afraid of *the grind*.
